Program 5:
A string is an almost-palindrome if, by changing(replacing) only one character, you can make it a palindrome. Create a function that returns True if a string is an almost-palindrome and False otherwise.

Return False if the string is already a palindrome.

You cannot remove a character only replace

Expected Output:

Enter the String - engage

False

Enter the String - abcdcbg

True





Program 6:

Create a function that takes in two words as input and returns a list of three elements, in the following order:

·         Shared letters between two words.

·         Letters unique to word 1.

·         Letters unique to word 2.

Each element should have unique letters, and have each letter be alphabetically sorted.

Both words will be in lower case.

If an element contains no letters, return an empty string

Even with multiple matching character there should be only 1 exist in the unique group

Expected Output:

Enter the 1st String - sharp

Enter the 1st String - soap

['aps', 'hr', 'o']

Enter the 1st String - board

Enter the 1st String - bored

['bdor', 'a', 'e']

Enter the 1st String - match

Enter the 1st String - ham


['ahm', 'ct', '']





Program 7:

Create a function that splits a string into an array of identical clusters

Each cluster should only have one unique character

The resulting array should be in the same order as the input string

Logic should work with letters, numbers and characters

Expected Output:

Enter the String - 555

['555']

Enter the String - 5556667788

['555', '666', '77', '88']

Enter the String - aaabbbaabbab

['aaa', 'bbb', 'aa', 'bb', 'a', 'b']

Enter the String - abbbcc88999&&!!!_


['a', 'bbb', 'cc', '88', '999', '&&', '!!!', '_']





Program 8:

Create a function that takes a list of items and checks if the last item matches the rest of the list.

Expected Output:

Enter the No of elements to add to the List - 3

Enter the element - rsq

Enter the element - 6hi

Enter the element - rsq6hi

True

 

Enter the No of elements to add to the List - 4

Enter the element - Anu

Enter the element - sai

Enter the element - Sri

Enter the element - AnuSri


False
